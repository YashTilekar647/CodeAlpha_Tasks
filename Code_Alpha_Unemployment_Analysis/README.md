# Code_Alpha_Unemployment_Analysis
This project involves analyzing unemployment trends across various countries and regions over a
period of time using Python. The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization, and generating
insights about unemployment trends globally.
## Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure to have the following installed:
- Python (3.7 or later)
- Jupyter Notebook or any code editor (e.g., VS Code)
- Required libraries
## Setup
1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unemployment-data-analysis.git
 ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
 ```bash
 cd unemployment-data-analysis
 ```
3. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
 ```bash
 python -m venv venv
 ```
4. **Activate the virtual environment**:
 - On Windows:
 ```bash
 venv\Scripts\activate
 ```
 - On macOS/Linux:
 ```bash
 source venv/bin/activate
 ```
5. **Install dependencies**:
 ```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
6. **Dataset**:
 Make sure the `unemployment_data.csv` file is in the `data/` folder. If you don't have the file, you
can download it from [Kaggle's Unemployment
Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yourdatasetlink).

8. **Run the Analysis**:
 To run the script, execute the following command:
 ```bash
 python scripts/unemployment_analysis.py
 ```
## Files
- **scripts/unemployment_analysis.py**: The main script for data preprocessing, analysis, and
visualization.
- **data/unemployment_data.csv**: The dataset containing unemployment rates for various
countries and regions.
- **requirements.txt**: The list of libraries needed for the project.
## Visualizations
- The script generates various visualizations such as:
 - Line plot showing unemployment trends over time.
 - Bar plot displaying unemployment by region.
 - Heatmap for feature correlation.
